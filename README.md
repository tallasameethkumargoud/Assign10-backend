This portal allows users to explore available jobs, view comprehensive job descriptions, identify necessary skills, and directly apply to job openings. The interface utilizes Material-UI components, providing a sleek and accessible user experience.

How the Project Functions
This project consists of multiple pages and components, all working together to deliver an engaging job portal experience.

Key Pages:

About: Details the purpose of the Job Portal and its benefits to job seekers.

Components:
Navbar: A dynamic navigation bar enabling easy movement between pages, constructed using Material-UI's AppBar and Button components.

JobListingsPage: Manages the rendering of job listings. It dynamically populates the listings using Material-UI components like Paper, Grid, and Chip, displaying essential job details and an "Apply Now" button.

Skills Display: Each listing features required skills shown as Material-UI Chip components, aiding quick understanding of job qualifications.

Responsive Layout: Utilizes Material-UI’s Grid system to ensure responsive adjustments across different screen sizes, enhancing the mobile viewing experience.

Styling and Theme: Styled using Material-UI’s built-in options, with additional custom styles for interactive effects like job card scaling on hover and button color changes.
